EasyEuler
=========
EasyEuler is a configurable command line tool for working with Project Euler.
It provides support for many languages out of the box and adding more is easy.

This project was inspired by [EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy)
and intends to provide the same functionality for a larger variety of languages.


TODO
